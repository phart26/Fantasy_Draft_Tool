## Configuration Constants

The draft and league format are controlled by constants in `Constants/constants.py`:

> **Disclaimer:** This tool is configured for a 2QB Superflex League format by default.

- `NUM_TEAMS`: Number of teams in the league (default: 8)
- `ROSTER_SIZE`: Number of players per team (default: 17)
- `TOTAL_PICKS`: Total number of picks in the draft (NUM_TEAMS * ROSTER_SIZE)
- `POSITIONS`: List of valid positions (default: ["QB", "RB", "WR", "TE"])
- `roster` (in `Draft_Tracker.py`): Dict specifying max players per position per team:
	- QB: 3
	- RB: 7
	- WR: 7
	- TE: 2

### Player Table Columns (for GUI)
The following columns are used in the GUI and must be present in the data:
- Name, Pos, Team, Score, Tier, Left In Tier, BYE, BYE Conflict
